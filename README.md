# Dilivery Driver
A practice project while learning Unity 2D. A game where the driver delivers all packages to the customer to win.

## Layout
![layout](./screenshot.png "Layout")

**Car**: Player  
**Purple squares**: Packages to deliver  
**Yellow square**: Customer to receive the packages  
**Green circle**: Speed boost

## Commands
**Move**: Up / Down arrow keys  
**Turn**: Left / Right arrow keys

## Rules
The player needs to control the car to pick up all the packages and deliver to the customer.  
The car can only pick up one package at a time.  
If driving over a speed boost, the car will move faster.  
If bumped into an obstacle (e.g. houses, trees, rocks), the car will move slower.
